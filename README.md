# Jenkins X Release Version

**This is a simple and standalone binary that can be used in CD pipelines to calculate the next release version**.

By default it:
- retrieves the previous version - which is the latest git tag matching the [semver](https://semver.org/) spec
- use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to calculate the next release version
- print the next release version to the standard output using a specific format

But it also supports other strategies to read the previous version and calculate the next version.

Optionnaly, you can also create a tag - and push it to a remote git repository.

## Usage

Just run `jx-release-version` in your project's top directory, and it should just print the next release version. It won't write anything to disk.

It accepts the following CLI flags:
- `-dir`: the location on the filesystem of your project's top directory - default to the current working directory.
- `-previous-version`: the [strategy to use to read the previous version](#reading-the-previous-version). Can also be set using the `PREVIOUS_VERSION` environment variable. Default to `auto`.
- `-next-version`: the [strategy to use to calculate the next version](#calculating—the-next-version). Can also be set using the `NEXT_VERSION` environment variable. Default to `auto`.
- `-output-format`: the [output format of the next release version](#output-format). Can also be set using the `OUTPUT_FORMAT` environment variable. Default to `{{.Major}}.{{.Minor}}.{{.Patch}}`.
- `-tag`: if enabled, [a new tag will be created](#tag). Can also be set using the `TAG` environment variable with the `"TRUE"` value.
- `-tag-prefix`: the prefix for the new tag - prefixed before the output. Can also be set using the `TAG_PREFIX` environment variable. Default to `"v"`.
- `-push-tag`: if enabled, the new tag will be pushed to the `origin` remote. Can also be set using the `PUSH_TAG` environment variable. Default to `true`.
- `-fetch-tags`: if enabled, the tags will be fetched from the `origin` remote, before detecting the previous version. Can also be set using the `FETCH_TAGS` environment variable.
- `-git-user`: the name of the author/committer used to create the git tag. Can also be set using the `GIT_NAME` environment variable. Default to the value set in the git config.
- `-git-email`: the email of the author/committer used to create the git tag. Can also be set using the `GIT_EMAIL` environment variable. Default to the value set in the git config.
- `-debug`: if enabled, will print debug logs to stdout in addition to the next version. It can also be enabled by setting the `JX_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `debug`.

### Features

- standalone - no dependencies required. It uses an embedded [git implementation](https://github.com/go-git/go-git) to read the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository's information.
- simple configuration through CLI flags or environment variables.
- by default works even on an empty git repository.
- multiple strategies to [read the previous version](#reading-the-previous-version) and/or [calculate the next version](#calculating—the-next-version).
- [custom output format](#output-format).
- [create (and push) a git tag for the new version](#tag).
- [github action](#github-actions).

## Reading the previous version

There are different ways to read the previous version:

### Auto

The `auto` strategy is the default one. It tries to find the latest git tag, or if there there are no git tags, it just use `0.0.0` as the previous version.

**Usage**:
- `jx-release-version -previous-version=auto`
- `jx-release-version` - the `auto` strategy is already the default one

### From tag

The `from-tag` strategy uses the latest git tag as the previous version. Note that it only uses tags which matches the [semver](https://semver.org/) spec - other tags are just ignored.

Optionnaly, it can filter tags based on a given pattern: if you use `from-tag:v1` it will use the latest tag matching the `v1` pattern. Note that it uses [Go's stdlib regexp](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/) - you can see the [syntax](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/).
This feature can be used to maintain 2 major versions in parallel: for each, you just configure the right pattern, so that `jx-release-version` retrieves the right previous version, and bump it as it should.

Optionnaly, it can fetch the tags from a remote repository named `origin`, if you set the `-fetch-tags` flag, or the `FETCH_TAGS` environment variable to `true`. It will fetch the tags before trying to find the previous version.

Note that if it can't find a tag, it will fail.

**Usage**:
- `jx-release-version -previous-version=from-tag`
- `jx-release-version -previous-version=from-tag:v1`

### From file

The `from-file` strategy will read the previous version from a file. Supported formats are:
- **Helm Charts**, using the `Chart.yaml` file
- **Makefile**, using the `Makefile` file
- **Automake**, using the `configure.ac` file
- **CMake**, using the `CMakeLists.txt` file
- **Python**, using the `setup.py` file
- **Maven**, using the `pom.xml` file
- **Javascript**, using the `package.json` file
- **Gradle**, using the `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts` or `gradle.properties` file

**Usage**:
- if you use `jx-release-version -previous-version=from-file` it will auto detect which file to use, trying the supported formats in the order in which they are listed. If a "format" supports multiple files (such as Gradle), it will try to read the version from each file - in the order in which they are listed.
- if you specify a file, it will use it to find the previous version. For example:
  - `jx-release-version -previous-version=from-file:pom.xml`
  - `jx-release-version -previous-version=from-file:charts/my-chart/Chart.yaml`
  - `jx-release-version -previous-version=from-file:Chart.yaml -dir=charts/my-chart`

### Manual

The `manual` strategy can be used if you already know the previous version, and just want `jx-release-version` to use it.

**Usage**:
- `jx-release-version -previous-version=manual:1.2.3`
- `jx-release-version -previous-version=1.2.3` - the `manual` prefix is optional

## Calculating the next version

There are different ways to calculate the next version:

### Auto

The `auto` strategy is the default one. It tries to use the `semantic` strategy, but if it can't find a tag for the previous version, it will fallback to incrementing the patch component.

**Usage**:
- `jx-release-version -next-version=auto`
- `jx-release-version` - the `auto` strategy is already the default one

### Semantic release

The `semantic` strategy finds all commits between the previous version's git tag and the current HEAD, and then uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to parse them. If it finds:
- at least 1 commit with a `BREAKING CHANGE: ` footer, then it will bump the major component of the version
- at least 1 commit with a `feat:` prefix, then it will bump the minor component of the version
- otherwise it will bump the patch component of the version

Note that if it can't find a tag for the previous version, it will fail.

**Usage**:
- `jx-release-version -next-version=semantic`
- if you want to strip any prerelease information from the build before performing the version bump you can use:
  - `jx-release-version -next-version=semantic:strip-prerelease`

### From file

The `from-file` strategy will read the next version from a file. Supported formats are:
- **Helm Charts**, using the `Chart.yaml` file
- **Makefile**, using the `Makefile` file
- **Automake**, using the `configure.ac` file
- **CMake**, using the `CMakeLists.txt` file
- **Python**, using the `setup.py` file
- **Maven**, using the `pom.xml` file
- **Javascript**, using the `package.json` file
- **Gradle**, using the `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts` or `gradle.properties` file

**Usage**:
- if you use `jx-release-version -next-version=from-file` it will auto detect which file to use, trying the supported formats in the order in which they are listed. If a "format" supports multiple files (such as Gradle), it will try to read the version from each file - in the order in which they are listed.
- if you specify a file, it will use it to find the next version. For example:
  - `jx-release-version -next-version=from-file:pom.xml`
  - `jx-release-version -next-version=from-file:charts/my-chart/Chart.yaml`
  - `jx-release-version -next-version=from-file:Chart.yaml -dir=charts/my-chart`

### Increment

The `increment` strategy can be used if you want to increment a specific component of the version.

**Usage**:
- `jx-release-version -next-version=increment:major`
- `jx-release-version -next-version=increment:minor`
- `jx-release-version -next-version=increment:patch`
- `jx-release-version -next-version=increment` - by default it will increment the patch component

### Manual

The `manual` strategy can be used if you already know the next version, and just want `jx-release-version` to use it.

**Usage**:
- `jx-release-version -next-version=manual:1.2.3`
- `jx-release-version -next-version=1.2.3` - the `manual` prefix is optional

## Output format

The output format of the next release version can be defined using a [Go template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/):
- the template has access to the [Version object](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3#pkg-index) - so you can use fields such as:
  - [Major](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3#Version.Major)
  - [Minor](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3#Version.Minor)
  - [Patch](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3#Version.Patch)
  - [Prerelease](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3#Version.Prerelease)
  - [Metadata](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3#Version.Metadata)
  - [String](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3#Version.String)
  - [Original](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3#Version.Original)
- the default format is: `{{.Major}}.{{.Minor}}.{{.Patch}}`
- you can also use the [sprig functions](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)

**Usage**:
- `jx-release-version -output-format=v{{.Major}}.{{.Minor}}` - if you only want major/minor
- `jx-release-version -output-format={{.String}}` - if you want the full version with prerelease / metadata information, if these are set in a file for example

## Tag

Most of the time, you'll be using the `jx-release-version` tool as part of your CD pipelines, so you'll want to do something with the "next version", such as creating (and pushing) a git tag. This behaviour is disabled by default, but can easily be enabled by setting the `-tag` CLI flag - or alternatively setting the `TAG` environment variable to `"true"`.

If the next version is `1.2.3` for example, by default a new tag named `v1.2.3` will be created. You can controle the prefix using the `-tag-prefix` CLI flag - or alternatively by setting the `TAG_PREFIX` environment variable.

If you want to override the name/email of the author/committer used to create the git tag, you can set the `-git-user` / `-git-email` CLI flags, or alternatively the `GIT_NAME` / `GIT_EMAIL` environment variables.

### Pushing

Creating a new (local) tag is great, but for it to be useful, you will also need to push it to a remote git repository. By default, when the new tag is created, it will also be pushed automatically to the `origin` remote.

Note that this operation might requires authentication - which you can provide using the `GIT_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Integrations

### Tekton Pipelines

If you want to use `jx-release-version` in your [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) pipeline, you can add a step in your Task which writes the output of the `jx-release-version` command to a file, such as:

```
steps:
- image: ghcr.io/jenkins-x/jx-release-version:2.6.0
  name: next-version
  script: |
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    jx-release-version > VERSION
```

### GitHub Actions

If you want to use `jx-release-version` in your [GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/features/actions), you can add the following to your workflow file:

```
jobs:
  yourjob:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.GIT_BOT_TOKEN }}
      - run: git fetch --depth=1 origin +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*

      - id: nextversion
        name: next release version
        uses: jenkins-x-plugins/jx-release-version@v2.6.0

      - name: do something with the next version
        run: echo next version is $VERSION
        env:
          VERSION: ${{ steps.nextversion.outputs.version }}
```

Or to create a new tag and push it, you can:
- use the [fregante/setup-git-user](https://github.com/fregante/setup-git-user) action to setup the git name/email to the [github-actions bot](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)
  - if you want to use a specific user, you can set the `git-user` and `git-email` parameters
- set the `tag` and `github-token` parameters

```
jobs:
  yourjob:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.GIT_BOT_TOKEN }}
      - run: git fetch --depth=1 origin +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*
      - uses: fregante/setup-git-user@v1

      - name: tag
        id: tag
        uses: jenkins-x-plugins/jx-release-version@v2.6.0
        with:
          tag: true
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GIT_BOT_TOKEN }}

      - name: do something with the next version
        run: echo next version is $VERSION
        env:
          VERSION: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.version }}
```
